- 👋 Hi, I’m @SatalinCliun , I'm a French programmer with 12 years coding and developing experience. I've done 3(1 year online courses),
-  5 year mastery in Software and Games Development and work with numberius companies and people. The familiarity I have with these codes range 
- from (Unity, All C, JavaScript, Python) 8 years daily use as per request, and many more smaller coding languages more unknown(less use on them)
- but I also work on other specific requirements like PhotoShop or digital Arts.
-  
- 👀 I’m interested in anything really, but messing around with technology is quite fun
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more code languages as I'm fimiliar with [Unity, all C (C, C#, C++), JavaScript, Python, Java, Ruby, Rust, CSS,HTLM 5, Bash] but do not have
- as much expirence with some of these, and I only have 4 years on photoshop or digital Art related programmes a good amount but no where near as much to be satisfied 
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Anything really, I mostly spend alot of time on personal request from companies or individuals 
- 
- 📫 How to reach me, I won't be online much as I only recently started GitHub and still have alot of work to do outside of the platform(Reason of join:Close Friend) but
- you can personaly messages me on my spare email that is with the company I'm with on GitHub, my work email will then be given if personal requests are agreed on.
